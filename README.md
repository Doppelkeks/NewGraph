# NewGraph
Our general node graph solution. This is build upon the idea to visualize complex data structures as graph networks without having to modify already established data classes, except adding [Node], [Port] and [SerializeReference] attributes to all classes that should show in the Graph View. 

This project requires:  https://github.com/Gentlymad-Studios/GraphViewBase and OdinSerializer (not inspector) to work.
