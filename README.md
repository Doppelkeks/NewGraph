A general node graph solution for Unity powered by UIToolkit (UIElements). This is based on the idea to visualize complex data structures as graph networks without having to modify already established data classes, except adding [Node], [Output], [PortList] and [SerializeReference] attributes to all classes that should show in the Graph View. 

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/Gentlymad-Studios/NewGraph/wiki) for installation & usage instructions.
