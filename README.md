NewGraph is a data-oriented node graph solution for **Unity** powered by **UIToolkit (UIElements)**. This is based on the idea to visualize complex data structures as graph networks without having to modify already established data classes, except adding `[Node]`, `[Port]`, `[PortList]` and `[SerializeReference]` attributes to all classes that should show in the Graph View.

This is planned to receive long term support as it is an integral part of our internal suite of tools at Gentlymad Studios.

### Requirements:
1. https://github.com/Gentlymad-Studios/GraphViewBase
2. https://github.com/Gentlymad-Studios/OdinSerializer (Original OdinSerializer repository: https://github.com/TeamSirenix/odin-serializer)
### Features:
* `WYSIWYG.` A port connecting to a node in the graph is a `real reference` to the object in your `graph .asset`
* Good performance even with many nodes as this is built upon  the new retained `UIToolkit` UI system.
* create visual data oriented networks based on your custom `[Serializable]` data classes simply by `adding attributes`.
* `Fully serialized dynamic lists` of ports with the [`[PortList]`](https://github.com/Gentlymad-Studios/NewGraph/wiki/2.-Usage#portlist) attribute.
* Customize data visualization with [`[GraphDisplay]`](https://github.com/Gentlymad-Studios/NewGraph/wiki/2.-Usage#graphdisplay): Display a field directly inside the graph? The side inspector? In both views?
* Full support of Unity's native `Undo/Redo` stack.
* Support for `Utility Nodes` that can be created to help organize your specific graph business.
* `Copy & Paste` even across graphs.
* No child `ScriptableObject` mayhem! A graph asset will hold all your data in `one single scriptable object`.
* `Cyclic references` and `complex reference chains` are natively supported with the use of [SerializeReference] attribute.
* `No reliance` on the now deprecated `Experimental.GraphView`. Everything was written from scratch or is based on maintainable code.
* `Keyboard shortcuts`, a `searchable context menu`, default UtilityNodes like [`CommentNode`](https://github.com/Gentlymad-Studios/NewGraph/wiki/2.-Usage#groupcommentnode), [`GroupCommentNode`](https://github.com/Gentlymad-Studios/NewGraph/wiki/2.-Usage#groupcommentnode), a extensively commented code base and more...
